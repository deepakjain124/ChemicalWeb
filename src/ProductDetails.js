    name: "Calcium Chloride",
    about:
      "We procure high-grade Calcium Chloride from reliable and authentic sources of the market. The powder is an ionic compound prepared by chemical reaction of chlorine and calcium. Moreover, it is a deliquescent compound which can dissolve in water very well. Formulated using high grade base material, it is widely used in several processes and operations related to industrial applications. Calcium Chloride aggressively absorbs moisture from the air, first causing a swelling of the crystals. If the air is humid enough and the temperature is high enough, the crystals melt and liquid saline solution brine) is formed.It works well over a temperature range from freezing up to 100C or more. At low temperature the salt does not absorb moisture under dry conditions. In practical terms calcium chloride desiccants are effective at Relative Humidity above 20-30%, but are relatively more effective under moist conditions.",
